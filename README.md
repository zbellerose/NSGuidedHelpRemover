# NetSuite Guided Help Remover

NetSuite Guided Help Remover is a simple Chrome extension that removes the intrusive Guided Help icon from NetSuite pages, giving you a cleaner and less distracting UI. NetSuite provides a way to hide this component, but it's account specific. If you're constantly switching accounts as a Consultant, Developer, or implementations team, this will be helpful.
